Flutter & Rust & Bing Copilot

This is an experimental third-party bing copilot client for linux, macos, windows, android, ios. Corresponding builds can be downloaded from BUILD on Github Action.

This app does almost everything the web version of bing copilot does!

This project is a forward-looking project, and a general client that supports more sources will be made in the future.
